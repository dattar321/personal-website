            <p>I believe I'm a learner maybe slow but still I like to learn new things! Now I'm doing undergrad in CSE in a university. So whatever it is it's gonna be relatade to programming. And as I always liked math & puzzle I d problem solve in different OJ. But Now in this lockdown situation due to covid 19, I started to learn web developing. And this is fun for sure. Hope I would learn many thing. But I want to learn more and work in backend.</p>
